- Touch targets:
  - Minimum recommended touch target size for interactive elements.

21) Accessibility & localization
- Accessibility requirements:

  - ARIA roles and labels for dynamic content (live region announcements when new events arrive).

  - Right-to-left support for languages that require it.

22) Real-time UX behaviors (what the user sees)
- Event arrival:
  - New event appears in timeline with brief highlight; existing visible content does not jump. An unobtrusive “2 new events” indicator appears when scrolled away from live feed, with a single tap to jump to newest events.
- Reconnect & snapshot:
  - If connection is lost, show non-intrusive banner “Reconnecting…”, then resume feed and show missed event count/button to fetch history.
- Rate limits visible:
  - When user posts too frequently, show gentle UI explaining cooldown and when they can post again.
- Graceful data corrections:
  - If later authoritative data corrects an earlier event, show the correction with an annotation “Updated” and reason.

23) Error states, edge cases & messaging
- Generic error banner with clear human language and possible actions (retry, go to home).
- Specific messages:
  - Match data unavailable: “This match’s live data is currently unavailable. Try refreshing or check again later.”
  - Image upload failed: clear reason (file too large / unsupported type / moderation pending).
  - Permission denied: clear explanation with CTA to sign in or contact support.
- Empty list guidance:
  - If no results, suggest actions (clear filters, try search, follow teams).

  - Friendly maintenance page with expected uptime and status link; admin announcements in the header when critical.

24) Privacy, reporting & user controls (what to present)
- Privacy page (user-visible summary) describing what data is used (favorites, email for notifications), and options to export/delete account data via settings.
- Clear consent: when enabling email reminders, show what will be sent and allow quick opt-out.
- Reporting flow visible and easy to use with acknowledgement of receipt and expected review timeline.
- Public profiles: username and public activity visible; private data hidden.

25) SEO & shareability (UI considerations)
- Share buttons on matches, team pages, and articles with generated preview text and image.
- Clear permalink UI for each match and event to share a specific moment.
- Social previews: friendly images and concise descriptions for each type of page.

26) Analytics & insights (visible to admins)
- Admin-facing dashboards should present: traffic to live pages, most-followed teams/players, top-commented matches, email deliverability summaries, and moderation queue metrics.
- Exportable CSV or report downloads for match stats and engagement metrics.

27) Personalization & advanced features
- Personalized newsfeed based on favorites and followed tags.
- Alerts tuning: users can choose channels (in-app only, email, or both) and threshold rules (only major tournaments).
- Comparison & watchlist:
  - User-created watchlists for tournaments or match groups.
  - Player/team comparison widgets with historical head-to-head.

28) Mobile app parity expectations (if later added)

  - Primary: “Follow”, “Set reminder”, “Open live”.
  - Secondary: “View stats”, “Compare”, “Share”.
- Microcopy:
  - Use concise, plain language: “Match begins in 12m”, “You’re following Team X — get notified when they play.”
  - Error tone: apologetic and helpful: “Sorry — we couldn’t load player stats. Try again in a bit.”
- Badges & labels:
  - “LIVE” (red), “FINISHED” (gray), “SCHEDULED” (muted), “UPCOMING” (accent).
  - Moderator labels on usernames (e.g., “MOD”), verified badges for official orgs/players.

30) Content moderation & community norms (what to present)
- Visible rules page for community conduct; short reminder visible during comment composition.
- Moderation transparency: when action is taken, show limited public audit line: “This comment was removed by moderator on [date]: reason.”
- Appeals CTA for moderated users visible in profile/moderation messages.

31) Data fidelity & provenance (what to show)
- Source annotation on match pages: small text showing where match data originated (e.g., official feed, community-submitted with admin verification).
- Timestamps for events in both relative and absolute formats, including timezone note.

32) Deliverables checklist (what the final product should include)
- Fully designed pages/screens described above for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
- All described user flows for Visitor, Registered User, and Admin including empty/error states, onboarding, and preferences.
- Real-time UX language and behaviors (event arrival, reconnect handling, missed events).
- Community feature set: comments, chat, moderation UI, image upload flows, reporting.
- Notification and reminder UX, with preferences and per-team controls.
- Search and discovery UI with filters, suggestions, and result grouping.
- Profile, settings, and privacy controls UI.
- Admin dashboards and moderation panels with clear actions and audit logs.
- Visual design guidelines: color palette, typography, iconography, and motion guidelines.
- Accessibility and localization requirements and content.
- Sample microcopy for CTAs, errors, onboarding, and moderation messages.

33) Example user journeys (concise)
- Visitor → Live match: lands on Home, sees live match hero, clicks “Open live”, watches live events and reads comments.
- New user onboarding: registers via Google/email, picks favorite teams on first-run, sees personalized dashboard with their teams upcoming matches and sets reminders.
- Admin moderation: receives flagged comment alert, reviews context in moderation panel, removes comment and logs reason.
- Fan notification: user favorites Team A; when Team A goes live, user sees in-app banner and receives scheduled email (per preference).

34) Final notes
- The product’s success hinges on clear, fast, and reliable real-time presentation combined with a friendly community space. The UI must prioritize readability of statistical information and provide friction-free ways to follow and engage with teams and matches. Every interactive element should be predictable, discoverable, and respectful of users’ attention (allowing them to customize notification and display preferences).

If you’d like, I can now:
- Produce a visual sitemap listing every page and its key components.
- Create explicit screen-by-screen annotated descriptions (e.g., exact content and element placement per match page breakpoint).
- Draft example copy and microcopy for onboarding, notifications, moderation messages, and tooltips.

Which of those would you like next?
